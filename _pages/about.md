Hi! I'm a junior student from [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in statistics. I am broadly interested in developing statistical methodology and theory. My goal is to develop new powerful methods for important scientific and societal problems, with robust (i.e., low-assumption and realistic) theoretical guarantees to ensure their empirical performance. With this aim, my research interests span  :

* High Dimensional Statistics 
* Machine Learning (Large Language Models, Generative Models)
* Optimization


My CV is here: [Yihong Zuo's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
