Hi! I'm a junior student from [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in statistics. I am broadly interested in advancing statistical methodology and theory, with a focus on developing innovative and effective approaches to address significant scientific and societal challenges. My goal is to develop new powerful methods with robust theoretical(i.e. realistic and require minimal assumptions), ensuring strong empirical performance. With this aim, my research interests include:


* High Dimensional Statistics 
* Machine Learning (Large Language Models, Generative Models)
* Optimization


My CV is here: [Yihong Zuo's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
