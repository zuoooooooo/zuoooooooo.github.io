Hi!👋 I'm a senior student at [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in statistics. I am broadly interested in high-dimensional statistics, foundations of learning, and principled learning methods. During my undergraduate studies, I had the pleasure of working with Prof. [Dacheng Xiu](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/), Prof. [Weijing Tang](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/weijingtang/home), Prof. [Zhouyu Shen](https://szyu123.github.io/zhouyushen//), and Prof. [Canhong Wen](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=352). 

If you are interested in my research or would like to discuss some interesting topics with me, please feel free to contact me!
