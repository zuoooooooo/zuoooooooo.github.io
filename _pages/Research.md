Research experience
======
* **mAIHT Pruner：An Monontone Accelerated Interative Hard-Thredsholding One-shot Prunning for LLM** （Jun.~Sep. 2024）

  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen ,The Department of statistics and Finance, USTC
  * Performed an extensive literature review, and devised a noval mAIHT algorithm for LLM Pruning basaed on $L_0$-penalised optimization .
  * Conducted a theoretical analysis of the algorithm and found that compared with existing heuristic algorithms, our algorithm has strict convergence guarantees and sublinear convergence speed.
  * Confirmed the algorithm’s superiority over existing baseline methods through rigorous experimentation, showcasing its
state-of-art performence in LLM Pruning.
