Research experience
======
* **An Efficient Pruner for Large Language Model with Theoretical Guarantee** （Jun.~Sep. 2024）

  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC
  * Conducted an extensive literature review and developed a novel monotone accelerated iterative hard-thresholding
(mAIHT) algorithm for LLM pruning.
  * Performed a theoretical analysis of the algorithm’s convergence and established its risk upper bound.
  * Demonstrated the algorithm’s superiority over existing baseline methods through rigorous experimentation, showcasing its state-of-the-art performance.
  * Prepared a manuscript in progress.

* **High Dimensional Confounding Model** (Mar. 2024 – Jun. 2024)
Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC 
  Conducted a literature review on high-dimensional probability and high-dimensional statistics, learning common
assumptions and proof techniques.
  *Reviewed recent articles on high-dimensional confounding models and reported to peers and instructor regularly.
