* **A Highly Scalable Parallel Algorithm for Trend Filtering on Graphs** (Nov. 2024 ~Present)    
Collaborated with Yinan Bu, Dongrun Wu     
  * Graph trend filtering is a nonparametric method that extracts piecewise smooth signals by minimizing the ℓ₁ norm of discrete graph differences. Traditional ADMM algorithms face inefficiencies due to the trade-off between convergence speed and subproblem tractability.
  * We introduce Doge-ADMM, a novel algorithm based on Differential Operator Grouping, which enables scalable parallel computation and closed-form subproblem solutions.
  * Experiments on 2D grid graphs demonstrate that Doge-ADMM achieves up to 30× speedup over existing methods in second-order trend filtering, making it highly effective for large-scale graph problems.

* **An Efficient Pruner for Large Language Model with Theoretical Guarantee** （Jun.~Dec. 2024）    
  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC   
  * Developed a novel monotone accelerated iterative hard-thresholding (mAIHT) algorithm for LLM pruning.
  * Performed a theoretical analysis of the algorithm. Established its convergence, convergence rate and risk upper bound.
  * Demonstrated the algorithm’s superiority over existing baseline methods through rigorous experimentation, showcasing its state-of-the-art performance.
  * Prepared a manuscript.

* **High Dimensional Confounding Model** (Mar. 2024 – Jun. 2024)    
  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC 
  * conducted a literature review on high-dimensional probability and high-dimensional statistics, learning common assumptions and proof techniques.
  * Reviewed recent articles on high-dimensional confounding models and regularly reported to instructors.
