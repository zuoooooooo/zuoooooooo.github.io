Research experiences
======
* **An Efficient Pruner for Large Language Model with Theoretical Guarantee** （Jun.~Nov. 2024）

  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC
  * Conducted an extensive literature review and developed a novel monotone accelerated iterative hard-thresholding
(mAIHT) algorithm for LLM pruning.
  * Performed a theoretical analysis of the algorithm. Established its convergence, convergence rate and risk upper bound.
  * Demonstrated the algorithm’s superiority over existing baseline methods through rigorous experimentation, showcasing its state-of-the-art performance.
  * Prepared a manuscript.

* **High Dimensional Confounding Model** (Mar. 2024 – Jun. 2024)

  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC 
  * conducted a literature review on high-dimensional probability and high-dimensional statistics, learning common assumptions and proof techniques.
  * Reviewed recent articles on high-dimensional confounding models and regularly reported to instructors.

* **Optimization Algorithm Project** （Jun. 2024）

  Advisor: Prof. Shixiang Chen ,The School of Mathematical Sciences, USTC
  * Reviewed recent optimization papers and presented a report in class.
  * Implemented sparse logistic regression using the proximal gradient descent and FISTA algorithm in Python, compared their differences, and conducted theoretical analysis.
  * Wrote a research paper documenting the methodologies and findings of the project.
