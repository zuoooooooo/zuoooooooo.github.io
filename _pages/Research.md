Research experiences
======
* **Personalized Generative Data Dimensionality Reduction** （Nov. 2024~Present）   
  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC
  * Conducted extensive literature review on group factor model and generative models(e.g. Wasserstein Autoencoder, Wasserstein GAN), developed a novel WGAN model for personalized data dimensionality reduction.
 

* **An Efficient Pruner for Large Language Model with Theoretical Guarantee** （Jun.~Dec. 2024）    
  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC
  * Developed a novel monotone accelerated iterative hard-thresholding (mAIHT) algorithm for LLM pruning.
  * Performed a theoretical analysis of the algorithm. Established its convergence, convergence rate and risk upper bound.
  * Demonstrated the algorithm’s superiority over existing baseline methods through rigorous experimentation, showcasing its state-of-the-art performance.
  * Prepared a manuscript.

* **High Dimensional Confounding Model** (Mar. 2024 – Jun. 2024)    
  Advisor: Prof. Canhong Wen, The Department of Statistics and Finance, USTC 
  * conducted a literature review on high-dimensional probability and high-dimensional statistics, learning common assumptions and proof techniques.
  * Reviewed recent articles on high-dimensional confounding models and regularly reported to instructors.
